            <li>The failure of Ippon to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not
                constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
            <li>You agree that Ippon owns all legal rights in the Service. You must not remove, modify or obscure any
                legal notices. You are not entitled to use Ippon's trademarks (especially "Ippon Technologies"), trade
                names, brands, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.
            <li>Violation of any of the terms below can result in the termination of your account or access to the
                Services. Violation of any of the terms will also terminate your usage rights of the Services.
            <li>If a provision of this agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction,
                that shall not affect: (i) the validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision of
                this agreement; or (ii) the validity or enforceability in other jurisdictions of that or any other
                provision of this agreement.
            <li>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Ippon und replace all previous
                agreements under this title. There are no verbal subsidiary agreements.
            <li>These Terms of Service, and your relationship with Ippon under these Terms of Service, shall be governed
                by the laws of France. You and Ippon agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located
                in France to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms of Service.

                purpose without the express written permission by Ippon.
            <li>You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Ippon has no responsibility to you or to any
                third party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms of Service and for the consequences
                (including any loss or damage which Ippon may suffer) of any such breach.
            <li>Ippon reserves the right (but has no obligation) to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse or
                remove any or all content or account from any of the Services at Ippon?s sole discretion. You understand
                that by using the Services you may be exposed to content that you may find offensive, indecent or
                objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk.
        </ol>
        <h2>4 Advertisements</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Some of the Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions.
                These advertisements may be targeted to the content of information stored on or made available to the
                Services.
            <li>The manner, mode and extent of advertising on the Services are subject to change without specific notice

            <li>You must not block such advertising.
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li>Any use of the application programming interface (API) is bound by the terms of this agreement plus the
                following specific terms:
            <li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension
                of access to the API. Ippon determines abuse or excessive usage of the API at its sole discretion.
            <li>Ippon reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access
                to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice. Ippon especially reserves the right to limit
                the number of requests via the API to a certain upper limit per time interval.
            <li>Your use of the API is free of charge up to a certain extent. Larger amounts of API transactions will be
                charged.
            <li>Ippon reserves the right to change the API's pricing model at any time. In such a case, you will of
                course be free to discontinue using the API.
            <li>As a user of the API, you may, within your product, indicate that your product utilizes the Ippon API.
                At other places or in other contexts, however, you may not use either the Ippon Technologies brand name
                or the Ippon Technologies logo. In particular, you may not use either the Ippon Technologies brand or
                the Ippon Technologies logo in the name of your product.
