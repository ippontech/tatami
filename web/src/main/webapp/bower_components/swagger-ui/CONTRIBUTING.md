SwaggerUI uses [SwaggerJS](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js) library for many internal operations. If you see errors in
[`swagger-client.js`](lib/swagger-client.js) file, you should probably open the issue in [SwaggerJS](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-js) repository.

Please open issues related to Swagger specifications in [Swagger Specs](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) repository.
